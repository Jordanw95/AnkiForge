                    When you create a deck on AnkiForge, you have the choice of a style for your cards.
                    All of the cards that are made by AnkiForge will include synthesised speech,
                    images and will be mobile ready. Please select one of the options below to
                    preview how the cards will look. I've only added styles that I personally use.
                    If you have any suggestions or ideas for a style (extra sides, different designs, anything in fact!)
                     you would like for the cards,
                    please get in touch using the contact
                    link at the bottom of the page.
